  <h1>Salt Lake City Walking Tour 🌄<br>
    <span style="font-size:0.6em;">From Mormon Grid to US Civic Center 🏛️</span>
  </h1>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Tour Overview 🗺️</h2>
    <p>
      <span class="highlight">Route:</span> Temple Square to Utah State Capitol 🚶‍♂️ <br>
      <span class="highlight">Time:</span> 4–6 hours &middot; <span class="highlight">Distance:</span> ~2.5 miles, moderate uphill to Capitol ⛰️<br>
      <span class="highlight">Theme:</span> Discover classic Mormon infrastructure, the city's grid, wide streets, religious and pioneer architecture, irrigation, and how US government influence shifted Salt Lake City's heart to the Capitol and government district 🏛️.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Stop 1: Temple Square & Mormon Grid ⛪</h2>
    <span class="stop-title">Location:</span> 50 N Temple<br>
    <span class="stop-title">Highlights:</span> Salt Lake Temple, Tabernacle, Assembly Hall, visitor centers<br>
    <p>
      The epicenter of Salt Lake's original grid, Temple Square was chosen by Brigham Young in 1847 as "Mile Zero" for Mormon urban planning. From here, immensely wide streets radiate to facilitate pioneer wagons and symbolism of community order. Street numbers reference their direction and distance from the temple, reinforcing its centrality.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="note">This stop represents the city's religious and infrastructural foundations.</span>
    </p>
    <div class="tips">

        <li>Free guided and self-guided tours available 🧭.</li>
        <li>Look for North/South/East/West street markers on signs 🛑.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="section">

    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Stop 3: Eagle Gate 🦅</h2>
    <span class="stop-title">Location:</span> State St. & South Temple<br>
    <span class="stop-title">Highlight:</span> Iconic arch marking boundary of Young's private estate and city core<br>
    <p>
      Originally built in 1859, the Eagle Gate was a symbol of Mormon power and the "Mormon Wall" boundary. Its placement illustrated the limits of church influence over the city, encompassing governance and daily life.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Stop 4: City Creek Irrigation 💦</h2>
    <span class="stop-title">Location:</span> East of Eagle Gate – City Creek Park<br>
    <span class="stop-title">Highlight:</span> Plaques and a stream segment illustrating pioneer irrigation<br>
    <p>
      The Mormon pioneers created a vast irrigation system using City Creek, enabling agriculture and growth. Modern plaques here celebrate these early engineering feats and the cooperative ethos behind the city's grid and development.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Stop 5: <span class="highlight">City & County Building — A Shift Toward Secular Governance 🏛️</span></h2>
    <span class="stop-title">Location:</span> 451 S State St.<br>
    <span class="stop-title">Highlight:</span> Grand government building with secular civic features<br>
    <p>
      Erected in the 1890s during Utah's push for statehood, the City & County Building signified a turning point: secular government and democratic institutions began to compete with or supersede church dominance. Non-LDS residents ("Gentiles") and federal policies shaped both its architecture and the city blocks around it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Why Federal Intervention?</strong> The US government intervened in Utah Territory beginning in the 1850s due to concerns about Mormon theocracy and polygamy practice. Congress would refuse the Utah Territory's applications for statehood for four decades, until the church renounced polygamy in 1890. The federal government viewed Utah as operating "a spurious Theocracy" where religious and civil authority were dangerously merged.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>The Utah War (1857-58):</strong> President James Buchanan sent 2,500 federal soldiers to Utah to impose federal sovereignty there, leading to the bloodless "Utah War." This established permanent federal presence and began the gradual erosion of Mormon temporal control over the territory.
    </p>
    <span class="note">This stop symbolizes Salt Lake City's shift away from exclusive LDS organizational control — introducing US-style civic institutions, federal law enforcement, and a diversified "Gentile" population.</span>
    <div class="tips">
      <ul>
        <li>Tour the plaza and grand exterior. Interior tours often available during business hours 🕒.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Stop 6: Main St./City Creek Center (optional detour) 🛍️</h2>
    <span class="stop-title">Location:</span> Between stops, south on Main St.<br>
    <span class="stop-title">Highlight:</span> Modern retail with historical water features; Kearns Building<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Pause at City Creek Center for shopping/dining and nods to the city's irrigation history 💧.</li>
      <li>Kearns Building shows non-Mormon commercial rise 🏢.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Stop 7: <span class="highlight">Utah State Capitol — The New Civic Center 🏛️</span></h2>
    <span class="stop-title">Location:</span> 350 N State St.<br>
    <span class="stop-title">Highlight:</span> Neoclassical building, government district, panoramic views<br>
    <p>
      The Capitol, completed in 1916, solidifies US government and secular authority at the literal and figurative city center. Its elevated siting above the LDS core visually and symbolically expresses the shift of power, statehood, and civic priorities that redefined Salt Lake City for the modern era.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Federal Victory Complete:</strong> By the time of the Capitol's construction, federal intervention had succeeded. In the 1880s and early 1890s, more than 1,000 Mormon men would be convicted of charges relating to plural marriage. In 1887, the Edmunds-Tucker Act took square aim at the Mormon church itself, disincorporating it and authorizing the federal government to seize much of its property. The church's 1890 Manifesto officially ending polygamy cleared the path to statehood in 1896.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Architectural Symbolism:</strong> The Capitol's neoclassical design deliberately echoes federal buildings in Washington D.C., asserting Utah's integration into the American political system and the supremacy of constitutional democracy over religious governance.
    </p>
    <span class="note">Ending the tour here represents the city's evolution from a religious nucleus to a government-centric urban form, the culmination of a 40-year federal campaign to bring Utah under US constitutional authority.</span>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>The Federal Campaign Against Mormon Theocracy (1850s-1890s) ⚖️</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Why the US Intervened:</strong> Congress would refuse the Utah Territory's applications for statehood for four decades, until the church renounced polygamy in 1890. The Republican party termed polygamy and slavery the "twin relics of barbarism" in 1854, viewing Mormon plural marriage as incompatible with American values.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>The Utah War (1857-58):</strong> President James Buchanan sent 2,500 federal soldiers to Utah to impose federal sovereignty there after receiving reports of Mormon defiance of federal authority. By May 1857, President Buchanan ordered Secretary Floyd and General Scott to dispatch a military force to accompany the territorial governor and newly appointed federal officials to Utah.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Escalating Federal Pressure:</strong> In 1862 the United States Congress passed the Morrill Act, which prohibited plural marriage in the territories, disincorporated the Mormon church, and restricted the church's ownership of property. In 1887, the Edmunds-Tucker Act took square aim at the Mormon church itself, disincorporating it and authorizing the federal government to seize much of its property.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Final Victory:</strong> In the 1880s and early 1890s, more than 1,000 Mormon men would be convicted of charges relating to plural marriage. The church's 1890 Manifesto officially ending polygamy cleared the path to Utah statehood in 1896, completing the federal transformation of Salt Lake City from theocratic center to American civic municipality.
